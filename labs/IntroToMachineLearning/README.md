# IntroductionToMachineLearning
In this lab we are going to learn how to teach machine learning models, 
how to correctly set up an experiment, how to tune model hyperparameters and how to compare models. 
Also we'are going to get familiar with **spark.ml** package 
as soon as all of the work we'are going to get done using this package.
