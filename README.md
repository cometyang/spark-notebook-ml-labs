# spark-notebook-ml-labs
All labs are implemented in [spark-notebook](https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook). In particular spark-notebook-0.6.3 with scala-2.10.5 and spark-1.6.1 was used.
In these labs we are going to get familiar with tools for data analysis and machine learning:
* [breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze)
* [spark dataframes](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide)
* [spark.ml](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html)
* spark-notebook visualization capabilities
